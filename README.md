# 🍽️ Online Food Delivery CRM

The Online Food Delivery CRM is a Salesforce-based application designed to streamline the end-to-end food delivery process for restaurants. It enables restaurant managers to manage menu items, process food orders, handle customer complaints, and generate insightful reports and dashboards — all within a single, integrated platform.

This capstone project was developed as a part of my Salesforce Developer Virtual Internship by SmartBridge in Collaboration with Salesforce, to demonstrate real-world CRM implementation in the food delivery domain.

## 📑 Application Lifecycle

### 1. Restaurant & Menu Setup
Restaurant Manager adds restaurant records and creates menu items with details like name, category, and price. This acts as the foundation for placing orders.

### 2. Placing Food Orders
Orders are created by selecting menu items. Validation rules ensure required fields are filled. Total amounts are auto-calculated through Apex handlers and roll-up fields.

### 3. Order Line Items & Calculations
When items are added, updated, or deleted, the OrderLineItemTrigger calls the handler to recalculate the parent order total automatically.

### 4. Complaint Handling Workflow
Customers' complaints are logged through the Complaint object. The ComplaintHandler updates the related order status (e.g., "Under Review" or "Resolved") automatically using Apex logic.

### 5. Automated Notifications
Flows and Email Alerts send automatic emails:
- **Order Confirmation** – Sent to customers after order creation
- **Complaint Resolution** – Sent when a complaint status is updated

### 6. Reporting & Analytics
Built-in reports and dashboards provide:
- Top-selling menu items
- Total revenue
- Complaint statistics
- Restaurant performance
- Executives can analyze trends to make data-driven decisions.

### 7. Role-Based Access & Security
- **Restaurant Manager** – Full access to restaurants, orders, complaints
- **Delivery Agent** – Restricted access (no sensitive fields like ID Proof)
- **Executive** – Read-only access to reports and dashboards
- Security is enhanced using Field Level Security, IP Ranges, and Session Settings.

## 📊 Dashboards

- **Restaurant Business Overview** – Total orders, revenue, and top items
- **Complaint Dashboard** – Complaint counts by type and resolution time
- **Performance Dashboard** – Real-time restaurant metrics
